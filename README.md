### Jambo, I am ***Akal Erupe*** ðŸ‘‹
### A lover of potatoes and everything code!

###Driven by the fact that if properly harnessed Technology has the ability
    to stimulate positive change in society.For her programming languages are only tools
    to achieve a particular goal. Suffice to say, she is not tied down to a specific 
    language ot framework. She is open to learning new technologies to maximize consumer
    impact. She sees programming as an art form to be consumed  just like any other.She is constantly
     striving to write clean and aesthetically pleasing code.When she's not coding you'll 
     probably finding her eating Potatoes or reading African Literature.
